**Tues 3rd April**

Lots of progress made. The snow break had been highly productive, and many of the essential features, and even a few of the ideal features had been struck from the project backlog. Issues had, however, been encountered.

Directions were working, but took about a minute to load and didn't return the nearest bike stand.

Markers windows contained graphs, but these graphs were ugly and wouldn't load automatically. In addition, the marker windows wouldn't close when you clicked on a new marker.

There were two versions of the front end in operation, and they looked like this -->
