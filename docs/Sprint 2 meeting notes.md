Brief standup meeting. Diarmuid was unable to meet with the lecturer.

Received news that Dublin Bikes has added more bike stands, requiring us to now regularly update the static locations.

Chen is changing 'get' requests to 'post' requests and worrying other what content should be placed in the infowindows.

Diarmuid is taking an extended break to wallow and basically do nothing/work on his data analytics homework.
